# About Me

👋 I’m **Jeff Flater**, the **creator of TestJeff**.  

I’ve been in **software for over 20 years** — the first 10 in **development** and the last 10 focused on **test automation, CI/CD pipelines, and modern testing frameworks**. That balance gives me the ability to see both sides: how to build software and how to break it.  

What drives me most is a **passion for testing, AI, and automation** — using modern tools to make testing smarter, faster, and more effective.  

Through **TestJeff**, I create **practical, hands-on courses** that help testers and engineers level up their API skills with tools like **Python, Behave, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Actions**.  

## My Mission
My mission is to:  
✨ **Simplify complex testing concepts** so they’re easy to understand and apply.  
✨ Help you build **real-world automation solutions** that are fast, maintainable, and scalable.  
✨ Share how **AI + automation** can transform the way we test software.  
✨ Give you the confidence to grow — whether you’re sharpening your testing skills or working toward a **Test Architect role**.  

## What You’ll Find Here
- 🎓 **Courses** built to be finished in a weekend — no fluff, just hands-on learning.  
- 🛠️ **Open-source projects** like [Mock JSON API](https://github.com/jeffflater/mock-json-api), trusted by thousands of developers.  
- 🌎 A growing [Test Automation Community on Skool](https://www.skool.com/test-automation-2381/about?ref=0e9720b6f3624bfea4710a21aed69e4e).  
- 🚀 A focus on the **future of testing** — blending **AI and automation** for smarter workflows.  

## Beyond Tech
Outside of testing and teaching, I’m:  
- A proud dad and family-first person.  
- A 🎱 pool player who loves a good game.  
- Always experimenting with ways to blend **AI, automation, and creativity** into everyday life.
