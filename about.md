I'm **Jeff Flater**, a software test engineer with over a decade of experience in automation, CI/CD pipelines, and modern testing frameworks.  

As the creator of **TestJeff**, I teach practical, hands-on courses that help testers level up their API skills using tools like **Python, Behave, and GitHub Actions**.  

My goal is to simplify complex concepts and empower you to build real-world automation solutions â€” **fast, effective, and maintainable**.  

Whether you're aiming to boost your confidence or grow into a **Test Architect** role, you're in the right place.
